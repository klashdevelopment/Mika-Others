### Hacks in the games

1. Q = Fly up
2. E = Fly down
3. Plus = speed up
4. Minus = slow down
5. Hold F to infinite-jump
6. You will start with 1000 of each material.
DaniDev's Karlson:
1. "U" Kills all yellow dudes and drops their guns.
2. "M" Teleports the milk next to you.
3. "Shift" + "M" Creates a new milk next to you.
4. "F" disables moving up and down (FLIGHT)
5. Lava is bouncy and wont hurt you.

## How do I hack muck myself?
Install dnSpy or JetBrains dotPeek, then open up the Assembly-CSharp.dll in the app. Modify the code, export it, and boom!
